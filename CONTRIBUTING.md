## How to contribute

As I said the goal of this repo is knowledge sharing, so to contribute nothing simpler, just create a folder with the name of the exercise.
The folder should contain the following elements:

- README.md : who detail the goal of your exercice, how to run exercice
- SRC : all sources files, with comment how you explain each steps
